# nimbleTestPkg

Testing nimble package scoping. What's the namespace problem with nimbleSMC?

To use this repo: first build and install it as a package in the parent directory:

```
R CMD build nimbleTestPkg
R CMD install nimbleTestPkg_0.0.1.tar.gz
```

Then, manually run the code in `manual_test.R`.
